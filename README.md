# For Study Purpose
This program is deprecated because the Industrial Engineering department at UPNVY has transitioned to a new Computer-Based Information System, called BIMA, which can be accessed at bima.upnyk.ac.id.

# BruteForce CBIS
The program was created because I was too lazy to go to the campus just to get a four-digit code. where the code is generated every semester. so i decided to create this program in c#.
## How this program work?
Simply put, this program only requires your student number to operate. It uses a linear search algorithm and 10 threads in the background to guess the correct four-digit code out of 10,000 possible combinations. To determine if the program is working or not, an HTML response is used. If the response matches the login page, it indicates that the program is not functioning, but if it's different, it may have worked. and then how to bypass the captcha? that's a different story.
